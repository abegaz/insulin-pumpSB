Work on the functional and non-functional requirements of your project. You are expected to elicit at least 
ten functional requirements and two non-functional requirements. Update the requirements.doc file in your 
github project repository 

Functional:
1.	Collects blood sugar levels from blood sugar sensor
2.	Sends data from blood sugar sensor to micro-pump
3.	Calculate how much insulin is required to maintain safe blood sugar level
          a.	Based on the rate of change of blood sugar levels
          b.	How many units of insulin required?
4.	If the reading falls in the UNSAFE ZONE (low blood sugar levels - we still need to define what this range should be) 
          a.	No insulin will be required. 
          b.	Alert the user they need sugar
5.	If the reading falls in the SAFE ZONE (target blood sugar levels - we still need to define what this range should be)
          a.	Insulin will be delivered under the following conditions:
              i.	Sugar Levels are increasing
             ii.	Rate of Increase of Sugar Levels are increasing
6.	If the reading falls in the UNDESIREABLE ZONE (high blood sugar levels - we still need to define what this range should be)
          a.	Insulin will be delivered
          b.	Only exception: 
              i.	Sugar Levels are decreasing
             ii.	Rate of Decrease of Sugar Levels are increasing
7.	The system should be able to inject insulin based off calculation
8.	Alert/Sound user if there are any anomalies, and display a diagnostic/warning message
          i. Create a ping system to locate the person using the (in case of emergency).
           system when something goes wrong. Should have some sort of location services in case of any emergency.
          a.	System Errors
          b.	Insulin resevoir running low
          c.	Blood sugar falling into the UNSAFE ZONE
9.	System must show blood sugar levels on graph, and insulin dosage log
10.

Non-Functional:
1.Programming must be done in Java.
2.Maintain blood sugar to stay in the SAFE ZONE; otherwise unhealthy blood sugar levels can lead to long-term consequences: 
          a.	High-blood Sugar
              i.	Eye Damage
             ii.	Kidney Damage
          b.	Low-blood Sugar
              i.	Coma
             ii.	Brain-malfunction
            iii.	Death
